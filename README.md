2016 Boston Globe Hackathon winner.

![Demonstration of swiping left/right and seeing houses with images and real estate information.](https://github.com/gopperman/ShackUp/blob/master/shackup.gif)

## What is this?
A neat little app that is a proof of concept for a swipe left/right type real estate application.

## Can I check this out?
Sadly, no - you would need an API that is not publicly accessible to run this proof of concept. Feel free to mock some data, though!
